## Project Overview

This project explores Uber's trip data to address several operational questions, such as peak demand times, the most active hours, and the relationship between rider requests and driver availability.

The dataset is analyzed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, with visualizations generated to better understand the data and answer the following key questions:

- Which date had the most completed trips during the two-week period?
- What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24-hour period?
- Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two-week period?
- What percentage of all zeroes during the two-week period occurred on weekends?
- What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver during the two-week period?
- When are the busiest 8 consecutive hours in terms of unique requests?
- True or False: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two-week period.
- In which 72-hour period is the ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs the highest?
- If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour, which hour should you choose?
- Which time might make the most sense to consider a "true end day" instead of midnight?

## Data Overview

The dataset includes information about Uber trips, such as:

- Date: The specific date of the data record (e.g., 2012-09-10).
- Time (Local): The hour of the day, represented in a 24-hour format (e.g., 16 for 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM).
- Eyeballs: The number of people who opened the Uber app during that hour.
- Zeroes: The number of users who did not see any available cars (e.g., the cars were either unavailable or all drivers were occupied).
- Completed Trips: The number of completed trips during that hour.
- Requests: The number of requests for rides made by users during that hour.
- Unique Drivers: The number of unique drivers who were available or logged in during that hour.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks
